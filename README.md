This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or`
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Advisor voice configuration

The advisor can read responses aloud with ElevenLabs. Add these values to a
local `.env.local` file; never expose the API key in client-side code:

```env
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_api_key
ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID=your_voice_id
ELEVENLABS_MODEL_ID=eleven_multilingual_v2
```

If ElevenLabs is not configured or temporarily unavailable, the advisor falls
back to the browser's built-in speech synthesis. Chat sessions are stored
locally in the browser and migrated from older Exur advisor storage versions.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
